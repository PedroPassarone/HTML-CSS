    <h1>Take Of Me</h1>
    <h2>Criminal dara darara darara AUuuuu<sup>*</sup></h2>
    <p>So many times it happens too fast
        You change your passion for glory
        Don't lose your grip on the dreams of the past
        You must fight just to keep them alive
        It's the eye of the tiger
        It's the thrill of the fight
        Rising up to the challenge of our rival
        And the last known survivor
        Stalks his prey in the night
        And he's watching us all with the eye of the tiger</p>
    
    <blockquote>It's been a long day without you, my friend
        And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
        We've come a long way from where we began
        Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
        <strong><u>When I see you again</u></strong>
        <mark>When I see you again (yeah, uh)
        See you again (yeah, yeah, yeah)
        When I see you again</mark></blockquote>
